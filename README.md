# Virtual-Mouse-By-Using-Eyes-Detection

This Artifical Intellingece  based project controls the mouse movement using Python,OpenCV and pyautogui with a real-time camera that detects hand landmarks, tracks Eyes gesture patterns instead of a physical Mouse

t helps the user to interact with a computer without any physical or hardware device to control mouse operation. This project is to develop a Virtual Mouse using Hand Gesture Recognition. Hand gestures are the most effortless and natural way of communication. The aim is to perform various operations of the cursor

Since This project is unique because normal virtual mouse is use by hand gesture But our project track the motin of pupil (EYES) .

#The features of mouse
Mice have a slender body, blunt or tapered muzzle, scantily haired, prominent ears, narrow hind feet with bald soles, and sharp, small claws. The thinly furred tail appears hairless; it may be about as long as the head and body, or it can be much shorter.


It is a python Based Project in which we used Various Libray They are Give below As  follow

#OpenCV
CV stands for  Computer Vision

Computer Vision
Computer vision is a process by which we can understand the images and videos how they are stored and how we can manipulate and retrieve data from them. Computer Vision is the base or mostly used for Artificial Intelligence. Computer-Vision is playing a major role in self-driving cars, robotics as well as in photo correction apps.


OpenCV
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features. 

The first OpenCV version was 1.0. OpenCV is released under a BSD license and hence it’s free for both academic and commercial use. It has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. When OpenCV was designed the main focus was real-time applications for computational efficiency. All things are written in optimized C/C++ to take advantage of multi-core processing.
